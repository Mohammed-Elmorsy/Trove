# Trove - E-Commerce Application

## Overview

Trove is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application built with scalability and developer experience in mind.

## Project Goals

- Build a working e-commerce application with core features
- Develop one full-stack feature at a time (frontend + backend)
- Test complete flows before committing
- Keep initial setup simple, consider deployment later
- Push to GitHub repo for version control

## Core Features

1. **Product Catalog** - Browse and search products
2. **Shopping Cart** - Add, update, and remove items
3. **Checkout & Orders** - Complete purchases and view order history
4. **Admin Panel** - Manage products and orders
5. **User Authentication** - Register, login, and user profiles (implemented last)

## Development Approach

- Start with basic functionality without authentication
- Use session-based cart initially
- Add authentication and authorization at the end
- Focus on working features over perfect features
- Incremental development with git commits per feature
